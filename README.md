# Dependencies

-   Node.js
-   React
-   json-server
-   axios

# Installation

To run the json-server, simply run "node src/Server.js" in the root folder and make sure you have "names.json" installed. After, do an npm install and either "npm start" or "npm build" and then "serve -s build -p 3000" to launch the application in the localhost address.

# Uninstallation

To uninstall, simply delete the application folder.

# Notes

For now the application is simple enough to live in the console and all the functionality is there, however I will likely implement a full web UI at a later point.
